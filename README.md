# Sudoku Solver

## Description
My attempt in making a sudoku solver using the concepts learnt in my Intro to AI course with my partner, Jack Chen. It implements algorithms we learnt such as AC-3, Backtracking, and Forward Checking. It also uses the Most Constrained Variable and Least Constraining Value heuristic for more efficiency.

## Instructions
The input file (input.txt) is included and it contains the mathematically hardest sudoku puzzle in the world.

Fork the repo into your own machine and run the script through the command line using "python sudoku_solver.py input.txt output.txt"

The solution will be printed in the output.txt file.
